## general

1. learn the api structure (20min all team)
2. Folder structure (including normalize css) (10 min by teamleadr)
3. Open repo and invite for collaboration (each should open new branch) (10 min by each)
4. Netifly (5 min by teamleadr)
5. Brain storm for pattern design (js,CSS,html) (each 2 hours all team)

## JS ->

1. fetch data (create async function) (15 min 1 person)
2. Create table obj to contain array of object and methode (time:tbd all team)
   3.1 personnel property [{id,name,city},{id,name,city},{id,name,city}...]
   3.2 holde methodes like (sort , delete , edit ,save/cancle, reset) (each for 1 teammemebr)
3. Create DrawTable function that take tableObj,row,column as parameters (1hr 2 person)
   3.1 Table will draw by grid/flex/table html
   3.2 data will arraive from tableObj

## CSS

- normalize css (5 min 1 person)
  -styling with 1 file (including media query) (45 min 1 person)

## HTML

-Each cell should be in input field that be block or been editable by js (time: tbd 1 person )
